\section*{Critical assessment of Paper 1.}
\subsection*{Problem that the paper tries to address}
Jan Bracker and Andy Gill's technical paper, {\it Sunroof: A Monadic DSL to Generate JavaScript}, attempt to generate JavaScript programs through the domain specific language, {\it Sunroof}, which is embedded in Haskell.
They discuss the usefulness of JavaScript (e.g. graphical canvases, event handling, and first-class functions), but also note that it lacks some desirable features, such as Haskell's static typing.\\

Bracker and Gill propose Sunroof as an alternative to JavaScript, since Sunroof is able to introduce many of Haskell's features to programmers that JavaScript is unable to natively facilitate (e.g. a threading model, a static type checker, etc.).
As expected, Sunroof has a foreign-function interface, which allows the extension of Sunroof's interface possible.\\

Bracker and Gill implement Sunroof through a monad similar to the \verb/IO/ monad found in Haskell, but uses an extra argument to determine which threading model is to be used.
